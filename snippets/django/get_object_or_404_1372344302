get_object_or_404
=================

get_object_or_404(klass, *args, **kwargs)
Calls get() on a given model manager, but it raises Http404 instead of the modelâ€™s DoesNotExist exception.

Required arguments
klass
A Model, Manager or QuerySet instance from which to get the object.
**kwargs
Lookup parameters, which should be in the format accepted by get() and filter().
Example
The following example gets the object with the primary key of 1 from MyModel:

    from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

    def my_view(request):
        my_object = get_object_or_404(MyModel, pk=1)

This example is equivalent to:

    from django.http import Http404

    def my_view(request):
        try:
            my_object = MyModel.objects.get(pk=1)
        except MyModel.DoesNotExist:
            raise Http404

Note: As with get(), a MultipleObjectsReturned exception will be raised if more than one object is found.
