Storing cookies in Django tests
===============================

Luckily, the django Client() stores cookies automatically! No need to pass
around cookies manually or create sessions (like with Requests)

    >>> from django.test.client import Client
    >>> c = Client()
    >>> r = c.post('/login', {"username":"someuser", "password":"somepassword"})
    >>> 
    >>> # c now has cookies! Now we can visit things logged in users are allowed to see.
    >>> r = c.get("/some-user-only-page")
    >>> r.content
